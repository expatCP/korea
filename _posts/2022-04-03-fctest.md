How to pay when buying goods on Coupang<br>

![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rg749ieiuTUGVgg8OO_O3ubxpLDd73C1X3ze2hM4tgWGpn2DNzkXHAR1EeT45D-na5_EB1APjXE-IQDhHu9YC6ffAAuLHGhY0wc8pdvoI1pKzsatR4DQ1mwSF25S8_Y4uVyfAklU)<br>

<br> 
If you decide to buy something, press the “바로 구매" (Buy) button on the right side.<br>

'장바구니 담기' = Add to cart<br>
'바로 구매' = Buy now<br>
<br>
<br> 
2. Enter Buyer and Recipient Information<br>

If you filled out this information at the time of account creation and buying for yourself, there's no need to make further edits.<br>
구매자정보: Buyer Information<br>
받는사람정보: Recipient Information<br>
![image](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ef0QrG1SJ5ShtVaI3re91nIDGyNhecOdAsrSshiw2Y2btWBT5SBbNEHgdPjpxL2V5ccHFF-csXF5awuveEPNFsjJrinPpatzkRmxLfHpSWBf6N1eLzqAHmrUdgHtMwBDDoHVTUvo)<br>
 
<br><br>
3. Pay<br>

Payment methods you can choose from:<br>
* 계좌 이체: Online transfer (must install a lot of things - not recommended)<br>
* 쿠페이 머니: Use the money in your Coupang Account. If you want to use a refund from previous times you should choose this option<br>
* 신용 / 체크 카드: Pay by credit card/check card (Recommended if you have installed the card's app card. Using this method when there is a need to cancel goods, you can directly get the money back via card instead of applying for withdrawal and going to a bank account is very troublesome)<br>
* 법인 카드: Pay with a corporate card (only if you own a business)<br>
* 휴대폰: Pay a small amount by phone (need to register in advance with the telecommunications company, the amount under 30,000 won - not recommended)<br>
* 무통장 입금 (가상계좌: Coupang will create a virtual account for you to transfer money into. This is the easiest way as there is no need to install anything, but when you return the product or for some reason, you are refunded, it will be a bit difficult to withdraw, the refund will be converted to Coupang money (see the second option)<br>
<br><br><br>
 

Then, you have to fill in payment information. We recommend that you choose option 3 - pay by card because if you get a refund, your money will be returned immediately. Select 3 - select your card carrier - select 일시불 (one-time payment) and press '결제 하기' (Payment)<br>

The first time you buy something at Coupang, you need to verify your identity with your mobile phone. Enter information, phone number, and get the verification number.<br>
